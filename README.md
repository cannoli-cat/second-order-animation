# Second‑Order Animation

Lightweight second-order dynamics for natural, procedural motion in Unity.

## What is it?

Drop‑in components that make any Transform smoothly follow a target using a spring‑damper model.

* `ProceduralMovement`: position follow
* `ProceduralRotation`: rotation follow (+ optional lean by movement)

## Use in 20 seconds

1. Add **ProceduralMovement** and/or **ProceduralRotation**.
2. Set **Target**.
3. Pick **Update Mode** (Update / Fixed / Late).
4. Tweak: **f** (faster), **z** (more damping), **r** (snappier/overshoot).
